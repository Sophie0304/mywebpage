# WELCOME TO MY WEBPAGE!

![undergraduate](mywebpageimage.jpg)

My name is Ye Xilei(Sophie). I am a postgraduate student in the University of Glasgow's
[Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/).
I work with [Dr. Sara Sereno](https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/staff/sarasereno/).

# MY RESEARCH INTERESTS

My current research interest is in twitter bullying, to discover contributors of cyberbullying, and I am also fascinating about the cognitive decision. I used to work on the topic of [choice blindness](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266912586_The_Influence_of_Facial_Attractiveness_and_Personality_Labels_on_Men_and_Women's_Mate_Preference) for my undergraduate thesis. The aim of this research was to explore how different emotion valences affects individual preference perception, and to explain mechanisms of choice blindness based on memory theories. I expect to give explanation of the choice blindness from neuroscience perspective.
